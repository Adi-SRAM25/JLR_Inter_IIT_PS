# JLR_Inter_IIT_PS

This simulink model of Thermoelectric Regenerative Damper was presented during Jaguar Landrover's Energy Harvesting System Challenge at Inter IIT Tech Meet 9.0.
We were awarded silver medal out of all participating institutes.

﻿Instructions Regarding The Models:-  


1. Quarter Car Thermal Power Gen model
   1. Open “QuarterCarPowerGen.slx”
   2. Run the “RoadProfiles_Inter_IIT.m” file to generate the road profile as a variable. 
   3. The variables for the car are already inputted in the Quarter Car model subsystem within the model.
   4. You may need to change the simulation time in Simulink to 120s. 
   5. After pressing the run button in Simulink the model outputs the power generated during the entire ride. 


2. Thermoelectric Regen Damper  ( Complete Model ) 
   1. Open “Thermoelectric_Regen_Damper.slx”
   2. Same as the steps i-iv that are stated above. 
   3. After pressing the run button in simulink the model outputs the actual power harnessed and the voltage generated through the Seebeck modules.
